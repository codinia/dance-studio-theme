                    <p class="text-bigger">
                        Lynn had been in business for 42 years, doing things the “old” way just like everyone else is running their studio. While following the techniques we teach in our system she was able to double the average student value of <strong>80% of her student base in just 4 days!</strong>
                    </p>
                   
                    <p class="text-bigger">
                        Imagine that. If 80% of your current students were suddenly paying you twice as much, how much of a difference would that make to your take-home pay? How much more dedicated would those students be to your programs? How much longer do you think you’d retain them? How much better would those students become?

                    <p class="text-bigger">
                        Jenny wanted to open a studio in a fairly rural area. There were well-established studios already nearby and she was starting from ZERO. (Check out the Google maps screencap of what’s located across from <strong> her one-room studio.</strong>)
                    </p>
                   
                    <p class="text-bigger">
                        Undaunted, she bravely implemented the strategies we teach and created a six-figure personal  income from the studio in less than 12 months. Following our marketing plan she enrolled 100 students in 95 days. Remember, that’s new students and ZERO word-of-mouth advertising. She’s currently still growing, just raised her tuition, and she and her husband are closing on a $2 million dollar new building they’ll be buying because their current space is bursting at the seams.

                    <p class="text-bigger">
                        Luis doesn’t own a dance studio. He’s a talented and award-winning martial artist. Could our program work for him as well? He was struggling to get new students and retain them as long as he’d like to. He also had problems with his tuition billing and many students weren’t paying on time. (That’s not uncommon in that industry, even with automated tuition.)
                    </p>
                   
                    <p class="text-bigger">
                        Working with us he was able to TRIPLE his tuition rates. He currently upgrades his students into higher-paying programs within 3 months of them enrolling in his fundamentals program. We showed him how to outsource his tuition billing so he never has to run after a late payment ever again. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-bigger">
                        Today he’s able to travel the world extensively to compete in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu tournaments and teach workshops. His studio runs smoothly, efficiently, and extremely profitably in his absence. He’s also opened a restaurant and implemented much of what he’s learned with us there as well. Most importantly, he’s an amazing husband and father with time to spend with his growing family.

                    <p class="text-bigger">
                        Pia’s situation is different. She has a studio in a large city, but still lives and performs professionally 794 miles away. She’s only home to physically step into her studio every once in a while. Impossible situation, right?
                    </p>
                   
                    <p class="text-bigger">
                        We showed her how to update some simple things on her website and she immediately enrolled ten additional new students in just two days! With less than 4 weeks of work she had a lead-generating and enrollment machine that didn’t just work all year round, but that<strong> she could manage remotely.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-bigger">
                        While Pia’s programs and classes were already world-class she has been dedicated to making great changes to her studio business by employing the business systems we advocate. She’s easily on track to DOUBLE her enrollment this year while also DOUBLING her average student value! How would your life be different if you could accomplish the same?

                        I also personally practice what I preach! Many years ago I was working like crazy in my own studio. Like many studio owners I wasn’t making enough money to pay the bills and had no time for my family and personal life. Today I only spend 3 - 4 hours per week to manage and maintain multiple profitable studio locations and programs. When I first took the leap and changed how I thought about my business it only took me six months to turn it all around.<strong> Now I run multiple six-figure locations.</strong>

                       We would all like to make more money with less of our own personal input. That’s a given. Most of us would also like to spend more time with family, be able to travel, and dedicate time to personal hobbies away from the studio. Most studio owners would also like to have more influence in their community. By increasing their ENROLLMENT and INCOME this is all possible.

                    <p>
                        If you’re like most studios you’ve already tried lots of marketing and advertising that hasn’t worked the way you’ve expected. You might struggle to find beginner students that are willing to be dedicated to higher-level programs and longer terms of commitment. Maybe you’ve even enrolled in other business training programs with lackluster results.

                        However, most studio owners are not capable of doing this because even though they are amazing instructors and artists most are still following an OLD business model that no longer works today because of some specific changes in the market

                    The old way of marketing a studio is to try to get as much information OUT to people as possible and then hope that they are ready to enroll after visiting a website. That’s been a losing strategy for a long time.

                   </p>
                    <p>
                        90% of the people that hit your studio website are NOT ready to enroll yet. Too many studio owners don’t understand this and are blindly trying to get cold traffic to enroll directly through a portal on their website. A very small fraction of people are willing to actually do that, so studios are trying to incentivize it by LOWERING their tuition rates. It’s a HUGE mistake!

                        A much larger percentage of new potential students are willing to trade their contact info if you’re willing to help them figure out what’s best for them. That’s the key. You need to be capturing and curating this contact info so that we can create a relationship with the right people and eventually get them enrolled.

                    The prospect pipeline is key to helping people to see the value in your program BEFORE they come in for a trial class, and BEFORE you’ve made an offer for them to enroll. Why are our clients able to charge literally 3 times as much as their nearest competitors, and convince new students to commit to 12 months of training right off the bat? Most of the heavy lifting for that is on this prospect pipeline.
                   </p>
                    <p>
                        So what is it?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s actually quite simple. It’s a simple series of steps that you walk a prospect through once they raise their hand and indicate that they’re interested in what you offer
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While you can probably see the value in your program, these beginners usually can’t yet. How are you better than your competitors? Why are you the right fit for this particular person? What problems are you going to help them to solve?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We need them to see clearly the answers to those questions BEFORE we make an offer to enroll.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        Running a prospect pipeline this way will help your studio to see several results.
                        <li>
                            The number of people showing up for intro classes goes up significantly
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            People now see you as their only option, not just one of the options.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            They have a relationship with your studio and trust you and your staff.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            They are more willing to pay higher tuition rates and commit to longer training terms because they see how it benefits THEM to do so.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Without a prospect pipeline in place studios also run the risk of enrolling the wrong students. Students and parents that complain about everything, or quit once soccer or lacrosse season rolls around are usually doing so because they don’t understand the value of what you offer. (That doesn’t mean that what you offer isn’t valuable, just that they don’t see that value.)
                        Studios that don’t put together a prospect pipeline are leaving thousands of dollars on the floor every single month. Such a simple system that solves so many problems.

                   <p>
                    Once Step 1 and Step 2 are in place, studios should launch a massive amount of marketing, starting with simple, trackable, digital marketing techniques.
                   </p>
                    <p>
                        All advertising takes either money, or time, or both. Launching this advertising before Step 1 and 2 are in place is like throwing money down the drain. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you’re not effectively capturing their contact info and then not following up and indoctrinating these prospects effectively then advertising won’t solve those problems. No wonder so many studios still have to rely so much on word-of-mouth advertising. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you’ve structured your advertising strategies correctly they’re trackable and you’ll know exactly how well they’re working. You’ll know exactly how much ad spend translates into how many new students you’ll enroll and then you can ramp that up quickly if you want to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        WARNING, and this is important, IF YOU DO THIS IN THE WRONG ORDER YOU’LL WASTE BOTH TIME AND MONEY. This is step three for a reason. Don’t do any additional advertising at all until the other two steps are in place, proven, and optimized.

                    This is where things really get exciting. Once the first three steps are in place, you have an enrollment machine. You’re at a point where you can start to raise tuition for new students aggressively and really increase your cash flow. Now you’re going to find ways to automate and outsource all of the other business systems in place and break yourself free from the front desk (or any other jobs at the studio you’d rather not be doing).
                   </p>
                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, too many studio owners have tried to implement in the wrong order here as well. You can’t automate or outsource systems that aren’t working and optimized yet. Just slapping an enrollment form on your website, for example, won’t work. The system doesn’t work very well so why would you automate that? Why would you try to scale something that is already problematic? You’re going to end up with more problems cropping up automatically and more frequently.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Order of implementation matters!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ignore that at your own peril. No wonder so many studio owners plateau. No wonder they burn themselves out. No wonder they run their studios for decades and never really make any significant income. DON’T AUTOMATE OR SCALE SYSTEMS THAT AREN’T OPTIMIZED.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another important piece of the puzzle here is to watch your stats like a hawk. We make changes to systems based on their actual demonstrable results and not our gut feelings. Some studios are actually following their stats closely, but don’t know what to do to move the needle. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    How many prospective students reached out for more info about your programs last month?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    How many of those people actually came in for intros?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Of those intros, what percentage enrolled into ongoing paid programs?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    What percentage of your student base do you lose on average on a monthly basis?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    With those numbers in mind we can go to work on fixing what’s actually broken. What should those numbers be? What should you do to get them more in line? If plenty of people are reaching out for more info, but no one is coming in the door, you don’t have a marketing problem. So, don’t try to fix the marketing problem first!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Only do the work that helps to move the needle where it’s most out of alignment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Studios that grow following that pattern free their founders from the front desk while generating systems that are hyper-profitable.

                        Another option is to keep doing things the way everyone else is trying to get things to work. Keep offering free trials and pushing for those direct online enrollments, convincing yourself that it’s actually going to start working some day. Obviously this isn’t the right choice. Studios, once again, lose decades of time and hundreds of thousands of dollars of income because they’re stuck in the old way of doing things.

                        When you’re able to create a lead-generating machine there is no more running after new students. You don’t have to just rely on word-of-mouth to fill classes. You’ll have new prospective students reaching out to you for help to get enrolled.

                    </p>
                    <p >
                        Implementing a prospect pipeline DOUBLES the number of people coming in for intros for most studios. If you had twice the number of potential students coming in for intros, how many more students do you think you’d have? 

                    </p>
                    <p >
                        Implementing massive digital marketing allows you to get in front of ‘cold’ traffic. Stay in front of the right ones. Studios can easily get 30-60 additional prospects per month reaching out with VERY little ad spend.

                    </p>
                    <p >
                        When you have steps 1-3 in place you’re able to significantly increase tuition rates and charge large down payments. This can easily TRIPLE the average student value of a new student in the first year.

                        You don’t want to be tied to the front desk forever. Once you have your enrollment system optimized it’s time to start handing off the day-to-day operations to other people, or automating it with software.

                    </p>
                    <p >
                        Most studio owners make the mistake of trying to scale or automate a system before it’s working well. By doing this step AFTER the other three we are able to effectively get work off the owner’s plate.

                    </p>
                    <p >
                        Here’s what is going to happen when you work with us:

                    <li>
                        You will be able to consistently attract new prospects at any time of year, including the Summer months if you want to.

                    <li>
                        You will be able to work with the kinds of students/parents that you want to; people that are dedicated and actually VALUE your program - not just people that are looking for a “fun” activity.

                    <li>
                        You’ll be able to free up enough cash to hire people to run the parts of your business that you don’t want to or don’t have time to. In other words, you’ll be able to outrun the “money problem.”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can take time off and manage your staff from literally anywhere in the world.

                        Everybody is trying to get their name out there. They’re performing in parades, trying to get into the schools, posting frantically to social media hoping that people will notice them. Then they’re heartbroken when people say things like “Oh, I didn’t even know you were here!” What better proof is there that that kind of marketing isn’t working as well as it could?

                    </p>
                    <p >
                        Instead, marketing efforts need to be focused not just on getting your info out to people, but getting their info into you!<strong> The first step is to build a lead-generating machine.</strong> For example, if your website isn’t doing a good job of capturing the contact info of people that are interested in your classes then you’re literally leaving thousands of dollars per month on the floor!

                    </p>
                    <p >
                        Studios that have gone through our training are able to focus their energy just on the activities that actually get results. You can still go march in the parades if you really want to, but our training will show you how to create a lead-generating machine that you can literally manage from anywhere. No more wasted time. No more wasted money. Just real results.

                    </p>
                    <p >
                        In the past studios have hired expensive website designers ($5,000), or relied on their relatives or students (risky) to help build a clunky website that doesn’t convert well. Now it’s as simple as following our proven templates and new students will be happy to hand you their contact info. Just this piece alone is worth more than $3500.

                    </p>
                    <p >
                        Most studios that implement just this part of our training can TRIPLE the number of people currently coming in for trial classes without paid ads of any kind. For many studios that can mean an increase in $30-40,000 in yearly income right away with no additional ad spend.

                    </p>
                    <p >
                        Too many studios are trying to directly enroll new students before properly educating prospects on why they’re so awesome! But now, by using the prospect pipeline you’ll not only get people to actually show up for trials, but they’ll be educated on your program enough to pay much higher tuition rates and even large down payments. This also has a big impact on student retention for beginner students. Do you see how easy that is?

                        Now we can launch cold-traffic marketing. (Studios that launch marketing before having the other two steps in place are always disappointed.) Not only that but you’ll be able to clearly see exactly how much return you’re getting on your investment. No more guessing if things are working! No more wasting money!

                    <p>
                        Many studios have been burned in the past trying to run ads. Not our clients! We’re there with you every step of the way to make sure that any advertising you’re running is immediately profitable. You could easily spend upwards of $10,000 hiring marketing agencies or experts that don’t specialize in what you’re selling. Most studios have wasted, on average, $8,000 per year on advertising that does not work and isn’t trackable.

Studios that take advantage of this generally do the best in our programs and accomplish their goals much faster. Coaching at this level with a team as talented and experienced as ours is hard to find, but you could easily spend $10,000 just for the coaching piece.

                        We make some claims that are hard to believe. Being part of a group of studio owners that are actually accomplishing these things is a big part of creating the right mindset for success. Every week we host multiple group calls where you can ask questions directly to Mago, the staff, and other studios in the program. There is no other group like this anywhere on Earth! People pay upwards of $500/hr just to have Mago review their studio  business and marketing strategies for them. Clients in our group get that and more on a weekly basis. This is worth way more than just the $2,000 price tag!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We couldn’t find the right software to help manage all of the workflows that we wanted in just one place so we built it. This package is awesome! We have current clients paying up to and above $200/mo just for the software itself. It’s that profitable for studios. You’ll get 6 months of free unlimited access to all it has to offer. . . that’s $1200 of free software. 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        (Just to be clear, if you already have software you’re using to manage your studio there is no need to stop using that. If you love it keep it.)
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        We also host a number of additional live events that clients get exclusive access to. Our systems are so powerful they will cause you some new problems! Good, better problems. That’s our ultimate goal. What if too many potential students start reaching out? What should you do with the additional income? What if you now need more space, or more staff?
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Those aren’t problems most studios have to worry about, but we’re tackling these higher-level problems with our mastermind clients all the time. We host additional live events and clients get free access to these events. Non-clients pay $2,200 just to attend these higher-level events.

                    <p> 
                        That’s all easily worth $30,000 but we can show you how to get it all for a fraction of that cost. All you need to do is book a call.”

                    Now, it’s important to understand that we can’t work with everyone. We limit the number of calls we do with new studios every week. If you’d like to talk more about working together make sure you schedule a call sooner than later. Once our calendar is full we stop booking calls and you’ll have to wait.

                    <p>
                        We also only have the bandwidth to bring on 8 studios per month. Once we’re full, once again, you’ll have to wait. It’s important to us that we are able to give the needed attention to clients and minimizing the number of people in our programs at any given time is the best way we’ve found to do this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also, not every studio is a good fit for our consulting, tools, and software. Studio owners that are willing to commit the time, money and energy into aggressively growing their programs are usually the best fit. But, we need to chat to learn more about what you’re struggling with and where you’re trying to get to before we can be sure that what we offer will work for you.

                        New studios are popping up all of the time, especially right now. The competition for students is getting more difficult in just about every area. The longer you wait to make changes the more difficult it usually is.

                    <p> 
                        Remember, it takes most studios 8 weeks, or so, to build out these systems. How soon do you want to make a change? These techniques will work at any time of year. How soon do you want new students?

                                        Too many studios are trying to compete on price. It's like they're all attempting to be the 'Walmart' of dance studios. This is a huge mistake and one we attempt to help correct as studios move through our training.

                                        While aggressively raising your tuition might not be the first thing we recommend studio owners change, we will work with them to help update their marketing messaging so that they can demand higher tuition rates if they choose to. . . independent of how thick the competition is in their area.

                                        So many studios struggle during the summer. Most areas don't see grocery stores and gas stations shut down during these months. That means that there ARE people in the area willing to spend money.</p>

                                        If that's true, it's just a matter of staying in front of the right people with the right message. Structuring your programs correctly means that you'll see an uptick in cash flow in the month of July. No more dreading bills over the summer!

We have great insights that other self-proclaimed gurus are missing because we are multi-location studio owners ourselves.

                                        Unless you're great at retaining drop-in students over the long term we probably won't be a good fit. It's too hard to get results for a student when they only come in and drop in for classes inconsistently. On the other hand, if you're willing to shift to longer-term commitments for students we're experts at making that happen.

                                        Our studio management software is awesome. It's a great balance of power and simplicity. It was developed specifically to manage the systems that we teach in our business consulting. Our clients get to use it for free when they're in our programs and get a 50% discount for life if they choose to continue using it.(Most do.) However, if you're more comfortable using what you're currently using that's perfectly fine as well. We provide it as
                                        a supplemental tool and believe it's the most effective way to manage the work you and your staff do at your studio.

While that's not the right fit for everyone, we want to cause you new problems! Better problems.

Some are even working to set their businesses up

                                        Most of the results that studios get out of working with us come because they implement ferociously what we teach. This is a done-with-you program not a done-for-you program. If all you do is learn some new things and never implement, it's pretty hard to expect to see any real
                                        results. The longer it takes a studio owner to make real change, the longer it will take to see results. 
                                        
                                    </p><p>
                                        While we can't guarantee that every client we have will implement what they learn, we can guarantee that if you implement you'll see the results. Just like all of the studios we work with!

                                        Of course this varies a little bit depending on where your studio business development is currently at. 
                                    </p><p>
                                        The goals and results we're shooting for with a studio that just opened last week might be different from what we're trying to do with a large well-established studio.

                                    </p><p>
                                        Our first goal is to help studios find the shortest path to adding an additional $100,000 to their income as quickly as possible. On our one-on-one strategy session phone call we can lay out for you a customized path to accomplishing that if you'd like.
                                    </p><p>
                                        If that sounds like a compelling goal for you to achieve then we should probably hop on a call and chat some more!

                                        The principles are sound. We back up our claims with math. While we need to learn a little more about your current situation before we can say for sure that what we have will help to grow your studio, we don't just make that decision based on a gut feeling. Our staff can review some very specific numbers with you and then show you how to make the decision based on those simple formulas.
                                    </p><p>
                                        The question usually comes down to "how fast do you want to grow?"

                                        Once again, this is going to depend a little bit on your own goals and how quickly you'd like to grow your studio enrollment. But, the systems that we teach will show you how to offset the cost of ANY advertising method we recommend with the cost of the intro program at your studio. We're literally helping you build a money-printing machine. 
                                    </p><p>
                                        Advertising that works is an investment that pays quick returns. It shouldn't be seen as a liability unless you don't know how to make it work.
                                    </p><p>
                                        All of that being said, most studios choose to kick-start their advertising budgets anywhere from $5 to $10 per day as they're ramping things up.
                                    </p>

                                        Usually not. We don't ask our clients to field testimonial calls for us. That's why we've recorded so many case studies.

                                        We won't ask you to do that either, though we'd love to add you to our collection of successful clients by recording a testimonial video with you after you've implemented what we teach.

                                        Our goal isn’t to win a popularity contest. Our goal is to help studios have a bigger impact on their communities. We’d love to show you how we can accomplish that with your own studio while significantly increasing your own personal income.

                                        Everybody believes they have a marketing problem. Lots of studios feel like if they could just “get their name out there” they’d have a lot more students. While that’s not entirely untrue, when we take a deeper dive into the numbers we always find some lower-hanging fruit that can increase the profitability of their business.
                                    </p><p>
                                        Ultimately, that’s the goal. We want to help studios to become hyper-profitable without having to be hyper-efficient. It’s not about you being able to run a perfectly organized business. There is an easier way!

                                        Running a successful studio does take a lot of work. Especially if your goal is to provide exceptional customer service. Handing off work to staff members and having effective systems in place to train and manage those people efficiently is something we help studios do all the time.

                                    </p><p>
                                        We do recommend that founders usually learn each individual job themselves before handing that work off to someone else. This usually means investing your own time in the work for about two weeks before training someone else to take it on.
