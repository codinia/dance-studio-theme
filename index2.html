                    <p class="text-bigger">
                        Lynn had been in business for 42 years, doing things the “old” way just like everyone else is running their studio. While following the techniques we teach in our system she was able to double the average student value of <strong>80% of her student base in just 4 days!</strong>
                    </p>
                   
                    <p class="text-bigger">
                        Imagine that. If 80% of your current students were suddenly paying you twice as much, how much of a difference would that make to your take-home pay? How much more dedicated would those students be to your programs? How much longer do you think you’d retain them? How much better would those students become?

                    <p class="text-bigger">
                        Jenny wanted to open a studio in a fairly rural area. There were well-established studios already nearby and she was starting from ZERO. (Check out the Google maps screencap of what’s located across from <strong> her one-room studio.</strong>)
                    </p>
                   
                    <p class="text-bigger">
                        Undaunted, she bravely implemented the strategies we teach and created a six-figure personal  income from the studio in less than 12 months. Following our marketing plan she enrolled 100 students in 95 days. Remember, that’s new students and ZERO word-of-mouth advertising. She’s currently still growing, just raised her tuition, and she and her husband are closing on a $2 million dollar new building they’ll be buying because their current space is bursting at the seams.

                    <p class="text-bigger">
                        Luis doesn’t own a dance studio. He’s a talented and award-winning martial artist. Could our program work for him as well? He was struggling to get new students and retain them as long as he’d like to. He also had problems with his tuition billing and many students weren’t paying on time. (That’s not uncommon in that industry, even with automated tuition.)
                    </p>
                   
                    <p class="text-bigger">
                        Working with us he was able to TRIPLE his tuition rates. He currently upgrades his students into higher-paying programs within 3 months of them enrolling in his fundamentals program. We showed him how to outsource his tuition billing so he never has to run after a late payment ever again. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-bigger">
                        Today he’s able to travel the world extensively to compete in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu tournaments and teach workshops. His studio runs smoothly, efficiently, and extremely profitably in his absence. He’s also opened a restaurant and implemented much of what he’s learned with us there as well. Most importantly, he’s an amazing husband and father with time to spend with his growing family.

                    <p class="text-bigger">
                        Pia’s situation is different. She has a studio in a large city, but still lives and performs professionally 794 miles away. She’s only home to physically step into her studio every once in a while. Impossible situation, right?
                    </p>
                   
                    <p class="text-bigger">
                        We showed her how to update some simple things on her website and she immediately enrolled ten additional new students in just two days! With less than 4 weeks of work she had a lead-generating and enrollment machine that didn’t just work all year round, but that<strong> she could manage remotely.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-bigger">
                        While Pia’s programs and classes were already world-class she has been dedicated to making great changes to her studio business by employing the business systems we advocate. She’s easily on track to DOUBLE her enrollment this year while also DOUBLING her average student value! How would your life be different if you could accomplish the same?

                        I also personally practice what I preach! Many years ago I was working like crazy in my own studio. Like many studio owners I wasn’t making enough money to pay the bills and had no time for my family and personal life. Today I only spend 3 - 4 hours per week to manage and maintain multiple profitable studio locations and programs. When I first took the leap and changed how I thought about my business it only took me six months to turn it all around.<strong> Now I run multiple six-figure locations.</strong>

                       We would all like to make more money with less of our own personal input. That’s a given. Most of us would also like to spend more time with family, be able to travel, and dedicate time to personal hobbies away from the studio. Most studio owners would also like to have more influence in their community. By increasing their ENROLLMENT and INCOME this is all possible.

                        If you’re like most studios you’ve already tried lots of marketing and advertising that hasn’t worked the way you’ve expected. You might struggle to find beginner students that are willing to be dedicated to higher-level programs and longer terms of commitment. Maybe you’ve even enrolled in other business training programs with lackluster results.

                        However, most studio owners are not capable of doing this because even though they are amazing instructors and artists most are still following an OLD business model that no longer works today because of some specific changes in the market

                    The old way of marketing a studio is to try to get as much information OUT to people as possible and then hope that they are ready to enroll after visiting a website. That’s been a losing strategy for a long time.

                   </p>
                    <p>
                        90% of the people that hit your studio website are NOT ready to enroll yet. Too many studio owners don’t understand this and are blindly trying to get cold traffic to enroll directly through a portal on their website. A very small fraction of people are willing to actually do that, so studios are trying to incentivize it by LOWERING their tuition rates. It’s a HUGE mistake!

You need to be capturing and curating this contact info so that we can create a relationship with the right people and eventually get them enrolled.

                    The prospect pipeline is key to helping people to see the value in your program BEFORE they come in for a trial class, and BEFORE you’ve made an offer for them to enroll. Why are our clients able to charge literally 3 times as much as their nearest competitors, and convince new students to commit to 12 months of training right off the bat? Most of the heavy lifting for that is on this prospect pipeline.

                        So what is it?

                    <p>
                        It’s actually quite simple. It’s a simple series of steps that you walk a prospect through once they raise their hand and indicate that they’re interested in what you offer
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While you can probably see the value in your program, these beginners usually can’t yet. How are you better than your competitors? Why are you the right fit for this particular person? What problems are you going to help them to solve?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We need them to see clearly the answers to those questions BEFORE we make an offer to enroll.

                        A much larger percentage of new potential students are willing to trade their contact info if you’re willing to help them figure out what’s best for them. That’s the key. You need to be capturing and curating this contact info so that we can create a relationship with the right people and eventually get them enrolled.

                    The old way of marketing a studio is to try to get as much information OUT to people as possible and then hope that they are ready to enroll after visiting a website. That’s been a losing strategy for a long time.

                    <p>
                        90% of the people that hit your studio website are NOT ready to enroll yet. Too many studio owners don’t understand this and are blindly trying to get cold traffic to enroll directly through a portal on their website. A very small fraction of people are willing to actually do that, so studios are trying to incentivize it by LOWERING their tuition rates. It’s a HUGE mistake!
